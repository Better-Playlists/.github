## Camelot Wheel explained by ChatGPT

The Camelot Wheel is like a big circle with different colors and letters on it. It helps people who play music to find songs that sound good together.

Imagine you have some crayons of different colors. If you want to draw a picture, you might choose colors that go well together, like blue and green, or red and yellow. It's the same with music. If you're a DJ and you want to play two songs one after the other, you want them to sound good together.

The Camelot Wheel has different colors and letters to help you find songs that go well together. Each color represents a different musical key, which is like a special code for a group of notes that sound good together. And each letter represents a different way that the songs can be matched together.

So if you're a DJ and you want to find a song that will sound good after the one you're playing, you can look at the Camelot Wheel and find a song that has the same color or letter as the one you're playing. That way, you can create a really cool and smooth playlist that everyone will enjoy dancing to!
